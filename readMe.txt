This is an HTML, CSS, and Javascript based portfolio website. It features a parallax layout with multiple divisions. In the navigation bar, you will find five tabs available to click on. They are titled “Home”, “About”, “Projects”, “Resume”, and “Contact”.The “Home” tab will link the viewer to the site’s loading screen. “About”, “Projects”, and “Contact” will smoothly scroll the viewer to the corresponding section on the main website. Only “Resume” will redirect the viewer to a separate page displaying the work. The contact form is in working order, as it is current running on a Google Script. To make the site a little more interactive and display more of my personality, I included an additional div with a Spotify widget embedded. It includes a few songs I’ve been listening to lately. I probably will continue to update it from time to time. The projects section contains elements from things I’ve worked on. It is structured as color photography, black and white film photography, additional color photography, and a few paintings.
