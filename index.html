           <h2>About Me</h2>
           <p class="animated fadeindown delay-2s">Hello! I'm Alison. <br> 
            I am a 22 year old college student currently studying Graphic Design at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. 
            I've lived in Rhode Island my entire life, and grew up apart of my family's first generation born in the US.
            <br> I have loved art ever since I was a kid. Some of my earliest memories are of being at home watching
            Bob Ross on my tv creating paintings that blew my mind. I knew from that point I wanted to somehow create something of that magnitude myself. Of course, three year old Alison could only
            scribble at that point. As I grew older, I began to experiment and dive into various
            mediums and styles of art. I am a designer, a photographer, and a painter. 
            <br>In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, traveling around, and seeing as many concerts as I can.
            I'm a massive music nerd who's down to talk about any genre!
            <br>
            <br>Whatever allows me to express creativity, makes me feel free.</p>
